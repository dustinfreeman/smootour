smootour
========

A temporally-smoothed contour class for OpenCV, with an approach based on implicit surfaces.

Inspired by my question on Stack Overflow:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23525856/simplifying-a-contour-to-a-fixed-length-to-smooth-over-several-frames

Where one poster observed that temporally-averaging points around a contour was not a useful approach.
